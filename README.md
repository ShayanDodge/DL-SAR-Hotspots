# DL-SAR-Hotspots

This repository contains the two Jupyter notebooks for Predicting SAR Hotspot Locations and Values:

**1. Predicting SAR Hotspot Locations (`Hotspots_Position.ipynb`)**
This section contains the source code for the research study "A Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Specific Absorption Rate Hot-Spots Induced by Broadband Electromagnetic Devices: A Pilot Study". The project involves a deep learning model for predicting the location of SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) hotspots using input images and frequency values.

**2. Predicting the SAR Hotspot Value (`Hotspots_Value.ipynb`)**
In this section, we describe how the deep learning model is used to predict the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value at the identified hotspot locations. The objective is to estimate the SAR at a given location within an image where the hotspot is located, based on both the image data and associated frequency values.
